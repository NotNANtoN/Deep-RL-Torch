To install apex correctly (including cpp) we need a torch installation that is linked with a cuda toolkit of the same version.

Normal pip or conda torch does not bring a full CUDA installation with it. Thus the bindings of torch need to be linked to the correct CUDA version on the machine. The default linkage will go to usr/bin/nvcc, which is usually empty.

Therefore, we might need to install torch from source. To do so we first need to properly install CUDA. After installation of CUDA, make sure to link the libraries correctly: step 7 in https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html. The most important commands are:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64\
                         ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib\
                         ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
                         
Now nvcc should be callable in the command line and "nvcc --version" should return version 10.2

After verifying this, we can try installing pytorch from source. Follow the instructions from the master in git and before the "python setup.py install" call add the CUDA_HOME destination by changing the call to "BUILD_TEST=0 CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-10.2 python setup.py install"

unfortunately, this does not work yet: [2829/3063] Building CXX object caffe2/CM...11_state_gpu.dir/python/pybind_state.cc.o

=> maybe not enough memory? probably not, need only baout 12Gs of memory....

I just tried copy pasting the 10.2 nvcc version into the "usr/lib" location, but that failed too.

New idea: https://dmitry.ai/t/topic/33/2 Look up .deb file for cuda 10.1 and try installing that instead of 10.2. Then it might work? I still think that the pytorch pip/conda version will not point to the correct nvcc...

This works! Install cuda 10.1 according to the instructions. Then:
python setup.py install --cuda_ext --cpp_ext --pyprof --user 
in the apex git

-----

Now try installing apex


(maybe export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="7.2" is needed for apex installation at some point)
